# Angular 15 News App

News application using newsAPI

--

## Considerations

- This project utilizes eslint, git-cz, and husky to ensure proper formatting and pre-commit practices.
- newApi has a restriction, only the api can be used locally, However I have created a mock in case the api fails in gh-pages
